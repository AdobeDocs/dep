### Start Learning

The Adobe Experience Cloud powers a wide breadth of Adobe applications that assist in the creation, delivery and personalization of content.  Underneath many of these applications sits the central marketing brain in the Adobe Experience Platform where data collection, customer profiles and segmentation starts within Adobe's CDP. Delivering those marketing experiences though happens in a variety of applications from Adobe Commerce and Experience Manager which build the glass that customers engage with to Adobe Target, Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, Campaign and more.  Understanding the underlying components of each of these applications and how best to operationalize these within your own martech stack is crucial to delivering on the promise of personalization at scale.
