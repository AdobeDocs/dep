NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.268
In this video I'll cover the various

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:04.798
identity types that you can use for user

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:07.620
management within the experience cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.175
There are four types of

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.160
identities that can be used today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.496
There's a Federated ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.166
This is the most strict

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.876
identity type that can be used,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.610
followed by an enterprise ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.516
A business ID and an Adobe ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.136
When we look at different ID types really,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.924
what an identity allows an organization

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:32.040
to do is control access to the license

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.629
applications that live within that IMS work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.526
So when we look at the Federated ID,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.863
this is one of the most strict ways

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:42.489
that you can enforce that control,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.650
because it's always organization owned,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.070
controlled and what we mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.490
by that is the authentication.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.015
Worship is typically done through

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.090
SAML integration and acclaimed

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.210
domain by the organization,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.930
and so the only people

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.650
who can ever get added.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.230
To the organization have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.190
be part of that domain name.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.745
This also means the organization

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.899
owns and controls all of the assets

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.531
that may be created for coming

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:08.228
from the Creative cloud space

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.970
and you get all the robustness.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.776
Typically that you would see around a

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:13.399
security and monitoring and password reset.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.858
That's again governed by your organization.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.396
When we get to Creative Cloud,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.936
you'll see a little difference here

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:21.960
between creative and document.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.340
Depending on what we're set up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.228
So if we're looking at this more from

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:26.729
an enterprise licensing standpoint,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.046
Federated ID's are supported.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.020
If you're looking at this more

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:31.338
from a team standpoint,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.500
so I'm buying this just

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.100
for a small team of people,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.675
then we wouldn't support the

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.342
Federated ID type and then always

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:40.638
supported across experience cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.308
The next type here is what's

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:43.420
called an enterprise ID,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.640
so it's still organizational and control.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.621
But the big thing that you'll see

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:49.685
here is that the authentication

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.095
ownership is really managed and shifted

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.248
here by Adobe on a claim domain,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:55.820
so we're in a Federated ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.536
The authentication is actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.681
owned by the organization that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.124
setting up their users, in this case,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:04.212
at the Enterprise ID Adobe will

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:07.240
own and manage the authentication.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.102
And therefore you start to see things

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:11.899
change as we kind of cut on the road.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.100
Here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
When you look at from a security

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.360
and monitoring standpoint,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.040
Adobe will provide its security

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.720
and monitoring such as content,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.935
log sharing restrictions and password

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.340
policies that will enforce where you

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.194
have a little bit different aspect

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:26.660
here of when you go with the Federated ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.360
There's more logging because the

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.060
companies ability to implement the

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.098
logging that they want using that XAML,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.310
deep integration,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.730
functioning behind the scenes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.842
Password control is managed through the

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:40.310
Adobe tool versus by the organization,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.333
so that does mean that the password

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.887
will be different than what

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:45.447
your password might look like,

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.193
and you see the same support here

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.172
when we talk about the ID type

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:50.642
in creative and document cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.606
When you look at enterprise versus

NOTE Confidence: 0.897580021875

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.300
looking at something for teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.228
And then the next ID type and this

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.023
is probably what is most common that

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:02.960
you'll see most people set up and uses,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.076
which is called an Adobe ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.544
So this is a user created account.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.834
If you went to the Adobe

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.100
website and created an account,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.316
you get assigned what's called an Adobe ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.510
So user controlled Adobe again

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.424
manages the authentication.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.630
But it's on any domain,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.478
so I can sign up with Gmail address

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:22.792
or Yahoo address or adobe.com address.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:24.196
It doesn't really matter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.916
there's no enforcement here and therefore

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:27.859
that's what we call domain agnostic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.476
And again,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.632
the user controls all the assets because

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:32.570
they're the ones managing the account.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.060
The security monitoring stays the

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.930
exact same though as an enterprise

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.482
ID because it's just using it to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:39.722
infrastructure to manage these users.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:42.090
So we give you the same access to the logs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.835
same sharing restrictions that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:45.580
can apply in password policies.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.860
And the password management

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.460
again is provided by Adobe.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.646
So there is a dual authentication

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.927
password reset flow where you'll see

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:55.530
a difference here is if we're talking

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:57.016
about creative and document cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.428
From an enterprise standpoint,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:00.540
you can't have Adobe ID's here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.087
You have to be on an enterprise

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:03.598
or Federated ID for valid reason.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.760
It is an enterprise license.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.497
Therefore we need to make sure that

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.748
the organizations are enforcing

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.930
that only on the domains they want.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.010
But it does work when you look at

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.359
more teams and again for across the

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.180
experience cloud. No difference now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.770
One of the challenges that you saw

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.430
with these three ID types is there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.322
often times that an organization

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:26.814
may be hiring out of sight of

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:28.820
their company for people to help

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.470
perform work within the tool,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.275
and therefore what typically would

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:34.731
happen is you might see that they

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.067
would create an Adobe ID for a person

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:39.268
to work within their organization so

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:41.538
I can have Federated or enterprise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:43.860
Set up within my organization and

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.660
I can also if I so choose as the

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:48.175
administrator to add people with Adobe ID's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.996
The problem is is if that person ever

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:53.072
leaves the organization anything

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:55.132
that they've created within any

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:57.089
of those license applications may

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:58.839
be tide back to that Adobe ID,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.328
and because they're no longer there,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.094
I do not have rights sometimes

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:02.976
to that content.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.492
This is you see the specifically

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:06.679
show up in the creative cloud space,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.800
more so than anywhere.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.150
And so Adobe has introduced a

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.260
new form of an ID,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.810
which is called a business ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.128
A business ID is a linked account,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.340
so it's controlled by an organization.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.380
So immediately shoves itself more into

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.490
a Federated enterprise ID tech mindset,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.586
but it's always linked so I cannot just

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.680
have a business ID without it being

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.435
linked back to either an enterprise or

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:34.171
a Federated ID and doesn't necessarily

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:35.656
need to follow domain policy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.680
It depends again on how

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.496
you're setting this up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.525
but what this allows organizations

NOTE Confidence: 0.817025973043478

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:41.550
to do is if they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:41.628 --> 00:05:44.093
implementing a Federated or enterprise

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.552
type ID for their user management.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.760
I can also set up Jill,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.548
who doesn't work for my company.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.182
With a business ID,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:55.309
Jill will have access to log into my

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.767
company suite of tools and use them,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.240
and when I revoke her access,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.780
anything that she has

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.090
created is now owned by me,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.314
the administrator and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:04.314 --> 00:06:05.844
company versus owned by Jill.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.554
So in the creative cloud space

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:09.731
you can think of this very much

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:11.356
as I'm creating some assets.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.872
Photos, graphics, logos,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:17.160
things that I'm working on with the company.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.980
I leave that company and those assets

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.559
were being created for the company.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.852
Therefore the company should own or

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:25.478
retain the rights to those not Jill,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.908
and so that's where the business

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:27.860
ID really comes in,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.576
and so you'll see again here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.009
It's really built for creative and document

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.449
cloud from an enterprise standpoint.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.606
So as those assets are being created,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.930
they're being created on

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.250
behalf of that company,

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.588
and therefore they're owned by that company.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.970
And that's a little bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.350
about the different types of

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.788
user access that you have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865933889411765

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.000
Thanks.
