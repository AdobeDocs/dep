00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.364
Hi, let's talk a little bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:02.364 --> 00:00:04.460
about the Adobe Experience Cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.071
But before I can jump in and really talk

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.918
to you about what the experience cloud is,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.195
let's take a step back and understand

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.500
what Adobe Cloud landscape looks like.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.840
There's two primary entities

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.180
that we're serving today,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.310
the business and the customers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.805
Businesses are trying to provide

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:21.790
a set of services and experiences

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.915
to customers that they're seeking,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.070
and likewise customers are looking for

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.358
those services and those experiences.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.514
And the cavern that exists today

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.636
is a tool set that allows this

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:38.316
communication to flow both directions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.928
This is where Adobe comes into the picture

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:43.379
with the various cloud technologies.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.575
The experience cloud allows businesses

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.770
and companies to deliver next

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:49.963
Gen experiences through a sweep

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.659
of various marketing tools,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.644
both from an activation,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:57.808
a planning and an analysis lens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.917
The Creative cloud sits in the middle

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:01.832
that allows companies to create rich

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.427
content to power those experiences,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.180
while also allowing customers to

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.296
create experiences themselves and

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.626
share those experiences with others.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.790
And at the end,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.530
is there document Cloud which brings

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.270
businesses and customers together

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.360
through a common framework of language?

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.733
All of this together is what allows

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.247
both a business and a customer to

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.096
interface with each other through

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:26.928
various mediums,

NOTE Confidence: 0.907607491818182

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.424
both across online and offline content.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.546
So what products exist

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.766
within each of these clouds?

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.600
Within the Adobe Experience Club.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.364
It's predominantly focused on

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:42.569
businesses being able to deliver

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.545
experiences to other businesses they

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:46.759
interface with or customers that they

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.846
sell their services and goods too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.712
This is done through a variety of

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:52.173
mediums such as customer journeys

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:52.173 --> 00:01:54.605
where we have Adobe target for on site

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.505
personalization or journey optimizer

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:59.070
for delivering in the moment messages,

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.652
whether that via email, push or SMS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:03.536
We have data insights and audience

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.809
tools such as analytics and customer

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:08.132
journey analytics to analyze both the

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:10.298
online and offline behavior of how

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:12.920
customers are engaging with your company

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.022
as well as audiences that allow you

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:18.146
to activate curated groups of people

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:20.267
into various systems to deliver.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.140
The next Gen experiences that you need.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.345
Content and commerce kind of backs us

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.596
up by providing a robust set of tools

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.970
from both a content management system

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.878
and a digital asset management system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.580
Through our experience manager.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.130
As well as a commerce engine

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:37.830
through Adobe commerce.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.414
And then marketing workflow through the

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:41.548
power of work front and digital enrollment,

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.566
non boarding tools such as experience

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.594
manager forms and Adobe sign help

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:48.018
to the planning process of building

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:50.097
these experiences and the data

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:52.097
collection necessary to power this

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.451
and underneath all of this is what

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:54.920
we call the experience platform,

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.864
the central brain that helps power

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:59.564
many of these tools from both the data

NOTE Confidence: 0.934264664444444

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:01.940
collection and an activation point of view.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.676
The Creative Cloud is focused on

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:08.506
as you would guess, creators,

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:11.422
whether that be through photo such

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:14.422
as Photoshop or Lightroom or through

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:16.227
graphic design such as Illustrator

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:18.628
and Indesign all the way into video

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:20.512
and animation such as Premiere Pro.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.580
After effects, animate and much more.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.128
There's even the UI UX side where

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:29.040
you see XD from building mockups

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.640
as well as after effects.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.476
And then the social media side,

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.690
where even customers are creating

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.900
their own content through premiere

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:37.972 --> 00:03:40.072
Pro and Photoshop Express and

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:42.904
sharing that content with the world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.164
And the last cloud is our document

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:47.169
cloud and this is predominantly

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.584
focused on standardizing the sharing

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:52.029
of documents digitally with anyone,

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.494
anywhere at anytime through PDF

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:56.390
and E signature.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.202
So standard tools you see in

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:03:58.202 --> 00:04:00.323
this space is Adobe Reader and

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.688
Adobe Sign and Adobe Standard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.838
Allowing the ability to create documents

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:06.679
in a repeatable fashion digitally

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.785
sign them and share them anywhere,

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.590
and exposing that also on mobile so

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.955
that you aren't having aren't having

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:17.517
to be hamstrung to A to a computer when

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:19.806
you need to look at that document.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.680
Create the document or fill

NOTE Confidence: 0.922784122

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.176
or sign that document.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873050858333333

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.426
This course though, is going to focus

NOTE Confidence: 0.873050858333333

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:29.190
predominantly on the experience cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873050858333333

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.154
And the products that live within

NOTE Confidence: 0.873050858333333

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:35.482
it to help businesses power their

NOTE Confidence: 0.873050858333333

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:37.998
next Gen customer experiences.
