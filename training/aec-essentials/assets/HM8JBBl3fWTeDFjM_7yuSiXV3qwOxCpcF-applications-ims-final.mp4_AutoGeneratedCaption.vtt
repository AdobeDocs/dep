NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.352
Let's take a look at an IMS org

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.878
in the context of applications.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.005
I think it's helpful to

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:06.905
understand at this point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.070
Is every application with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.860
Adobe Experience Cloud is

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.160
either a SaaS based application,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.885
meaning it's a multi tenant

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.218
infrastructure behind it or

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:18.006
it's a non SAS based application

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.048
which likely means it's a single

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:21.500
tenant infrastructure behind it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.275
And not all applications can

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.690
run within an IMS org meeting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.658
Not all applications get their user

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:29.630
access rights and permissions from an IMS,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.297
or they may be actually self policed

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:33.960
within the application itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.640
So what applications are native

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.584
to an IMS or from a provisioning

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:40.980
perspective as well as user access

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.759
control is managed at the store level,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.590
so analytics,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.665
audience manager and target are

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.057
kind of the first three that

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.556
you see show up here where these

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.670
applications are sass based.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.632
In user access control to them

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:57.968
is managed at the IMS org level.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.860
There are also multi tenant so

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.402
there can only ever be 1 analytics

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:03.210
license deployed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.734
1 Outings,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.306
manager license or one target license,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.780
deployed perms org and there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.510
ways to section off within those

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.250
individual solutions and analytics.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.912
We call them report suites and

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:15.020
audience metrics data sources

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.550
and then target it's workspaces.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.790
But a way to give different teams

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.774
ways to play with in their own space

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:24.009
without touching another team's data.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.068
This looks a little different when

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:29.500
you talk about some of the other

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.448
applications that we have sitting

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:33.720
outside here on the left experience platform.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.010
Actually,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.750
before I figured out it falls

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.197
into the same camp experience,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.174
platform and all of its app services.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.968
It kind of set on top.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.314
Also,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:43.378
can only have one license provisioned

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:46.043
by an IMS org and it also provides

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.080
its own way of creating separation

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.534
of data for between teams and

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:52.058
business units through something

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:53.210
that we call sandboxes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.754
which we learn about in a different module.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.460
So what do we kind of do left with all

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:02.017
these other applications over here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.260
This is kind of interesting,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.376
so when we look at Marketo,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.156
Marketo kind of lives here on the edge.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.248
And what I mean by this is user

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:09.998
access control is actually managed

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:11.948
within the Marketo instance itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.782
But it has the ability to be connected

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:13.782 --> 00:02:15.828
to an IMS work and so IT company

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:17.492
can actually have many licenses are

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:19.244
from our keto and therefore connect

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:21.290
many of them too and optionally

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.070
into the IMS work campaign.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.810
V7 actually looks the same way,

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.138
so you can have many campaign instances here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.985
That start to show up and you start to

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.706
see the it's a little different though

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:35.533
when you get to campaign standard

NOTE Confidence: 0.795883367692308

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.129
campaign standard actually was.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.278
A tool that we built that is SAS

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:43.206
based but it's single tenant so

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.252
there can be many campaign standard

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:45.312 --> 00:02:47.310
instances that a customer may be

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.180
running and operating with M&amp;amp;MS org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.100
But they are already provisioned and

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.217
all the user access controls actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:56.966
managed within IMS work not within

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:59.338
the singular application itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.020
And then you kind of have

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.140
experience manager and magenta.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.950
The comments engine I'm sitting

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.811
off to the side and these kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.093
fall into a hybrid camp as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.576
Depending on which version of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.652
So experience manager actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:12.992
comes in three versions today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.940
We have experience manager kind of old.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.016
This is the on Prem solution,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.804
not IMS or compatible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:23.220
Licensed but not connected to an IMS org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.972
You've experienced manager,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:27.568
cloud services or managed services scuse

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:30.508
me which can be connected to an IMS org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.086
And then you have experience Manager cloud

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:37.066
service different than managed service.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.060
So experience manager managed services

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.050
about us hosting the infrastructure

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.767
for you or cloud services truly

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.832
making it scalable based off of

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:47.509
the cloud architecture and we host.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.100
And that is always I'm IMS specific.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.492
From that perspective,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:54.812
the Magento Commerce engine currently

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:57.119
lives more along the experience

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.900
manager on Prem solution standpoint,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.388
but there's a lot of active work right

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:03.056
now to bring this in and to make it

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:04.657
live more here on the edge we have the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:06.256
option to hook it up and collect it

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:08.414
and you'll see a lot of this coming

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.866
through enhanced data collection

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:12.440
plugins where we can actually tag users.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.624
If you remember going back to this screen

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:15.624 --> 00:04:18.100
with that and being able to bring that

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.780
forward so that functioning can be captured.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.764
A collection time off of these solutions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.170
And it actually brings up a

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.460
really good point with that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.068
We're easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.826
It plays on these solutions as it starts to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:33.953
really exist when you look at analytics.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:36.568
When you look at Target.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.890
When you look at audience manager,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.800
this is really where the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.860
easy ideas starts to show up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.813
In a lot of our solutions because

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:43.749
this is where your digital first

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.344
party data that you're collecting

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:47.234
on that customer coming to your

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:48.350
website starts to happen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.436
And in the magenta and the experience

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.970
manager stack usually see this

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.472
deployed through our SDK's or

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:55.338
will start to collect this data.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.565
Campaign Marketo can really don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:01.890
have easy ideas 'cause they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.879
based off of an unknown customer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.520
So you typically have a permit

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.840
in these spaces.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.160
Which is what's most common,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.777
but they also can get an easy

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:13.918
ID if a customer comes online,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.995
so something that you'll typically

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:17.157
see in these solutions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:17.157 --> 00:05:18.900
and I'm kind of notating it here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.644
You'll see us here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.660
and there may be an easy ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.490
Optionally.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.546
If this customer ever activates online,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.069
the most common way that you'll see

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.549
these things kind of show up here is,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.506
let's say,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:35.418
the customer does something

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.586
where you've sent a new email.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.090
Or a push message and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.87164254

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.090
they open or click

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:41.990
that message. That's why you would start

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.887
to see them getting a nice ideas because

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:46.240
we're able to at that time tie them

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.230
back to something that they've done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.742
And so this is just a friendly reminder

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:50.742 --> 00:05:53.547
of how these solutions kind of work

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:56.328
together within IMS work and how you

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:56.328 --> 00:05:58.340
can think about architecting things,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.830
especially when a customer has a

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.652
variety of different solutions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:05.388
Why some of them may be plentiful within

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:06:05.388 --> 00:06:07.580
IMS organ? Why you may only see one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87598387

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.000
For other solutions out there. Thanks.
