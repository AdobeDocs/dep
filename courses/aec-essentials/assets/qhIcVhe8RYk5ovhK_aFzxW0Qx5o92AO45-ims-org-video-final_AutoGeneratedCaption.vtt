NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
So what is an IMS org?

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.212
Really, at the end of the day and

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:07.410
IMS work is nothing more than a

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.065
collection of the applications that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:12.440
a company has licensed the users.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.188
That they would like to have within their

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.908
company have accessed those applications.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.388
And then the permissions that bind those

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.390
users to the applications in question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.200
And so that I am,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.666
or really at the end of the days away

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.213
for Adobe to figure out how we provide

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:33.938
to a company or organization their

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:35.546
applications and for the organization

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.770
to be able to manage users that don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.295
want to use those applications.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.016
And oftentimes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:42.164
what you'll see in companies is

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:44.512
that overtime there may be different

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.144
divisions within that company,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.310
or there may be different.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.074
Teams within that company that also

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:51.770
want to license Adobe software,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.135
and So what they'll do is they'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:54.408
also get their own license for,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.370
let's say Adobe Analytics or Adobe Target,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520
separate from the license that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.810
another team has,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.350
and therefore they will get

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.890
provisioned and thrown IMS org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.550
Now it's still under the

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.546
company umbrella here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.750
but now I end up with two different

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.907
IMS organs which we can call IMS org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.627
If you will,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:15.082
and I MSRB and this is what you'll often

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.595
see with very large companies or companies

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:19.930
that have a very decentralized model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.292
Sometimes I miss orcs are broken

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:22.993
down by brand or you'll see them

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:24.715
kind of broken down by business unit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.990
But this functionality is kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.006
of what you see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.090
You also see the same pattern show up

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.229
when we really look at acquisition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.792
So you can imagine taking this

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.500
example if you will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860
And there's two different companies,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.388
so we have company a here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.110
Who has an existing IMS arc?

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.440
And Company B has a different IMS org and

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.541
at some point company A&amp;amp;B merged together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.426
And so immediately what happens

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:55.904
is you kind of can imagine that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:57.956
those companies may want to bring

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.906
all of their data together into

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.760
a new company formed here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.626
Called C.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:06.224
And therefore what this function will

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:09.404
look like as I have now one IMS org

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:12.569
underneath and I want all these applications,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.666
permissions and users from

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:17.286
both companies to exist today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.408
This would not work because those

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:21.860
licenses are assigned at a company level,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.450
not at an organizational level,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.635
and thereby all of the data that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.393
lives within those orgs is tide

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:31.125
to that specific org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.064
So why does this matter?

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:34.390
Well,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.791
something to keep in mind is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.528
also within all of these orcs is this

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:41.633
concept of what's called an ECID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.894
And you may have heard this before

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:46.209
if you've worked with the Adobe

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.048
Target Products or Adobe Analytics,

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:48.048 --> 00:02:50.470
but an easy ID is really nothing

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.422
more than an identifier that

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.930
lives within each org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.156
That tells us about who those

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.569
people are browsing on the website.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.950
It's a first party cookie that is

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.110
created and assigned based on IMS Org.

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.285
So wanting to translate company

NOTE Confidence: 0.723172245

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.025
A&amp;amp;B here into company.

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.262
See, I can't actually move any of this

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:12.508
anonymous behavioral data from analytics.

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.574
Or target because they're running and

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:16.788
being powered off of this easy ID.

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.750
That's only specific that org,

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.153
so I'd have to build a whole new version

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:23.386
of that easy ID and really start over.

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:26.336
And this is where you start to see some of

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:28.420
these pain points with multiple IMS orcs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.118
Hopefully that helps explain a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:31.739
bit about why there's IMS orgs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.854
how companies can end up with multiple,

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.512
and then what companies are starting to

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:37.722
do now as they start to try to figure

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:39.665
out who their customer is kind of across

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.334
their business and some of the challenges

NOTE Confidence: 0.768941047692308

00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:43.000
that they run into with that, thanks.
